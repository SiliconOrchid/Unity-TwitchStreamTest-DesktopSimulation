# Unity : TwitchStreamTest - DesktopSimulation

Solution in this repo was used to generate test videos found in my blogsite:

* [Impact of stream quality for live coders](https://blogs.siliconorchid.com/post/coding-inspiration/streaming-livecoders/)

<hr/>

## What are we doing?

I didn't have the time/inclination to learn whether I could move actual windows around a Win10 desktop programatically ... so I used Unity to quickly put together a "fake windows" program.

This animates a "window" of code (cube with a texture) from side to side.

This was used to provide precise repeated movements for capturing a bunch of videos found in the blog linked above.

## Note

I've included the compiled Windows version of the "game" in the subfolder `WindowAnimatorBuild`, meaning you don't need to install Unity to run the same test.
